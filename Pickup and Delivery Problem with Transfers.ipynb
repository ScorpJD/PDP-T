    "## Introduction\n",
    "In many logistics problems we require to pick some products in one place and take them to another place, which is exactly why we define the pickup and delivery problem (PDP), in this problem a set of vehicles pick up and deliver a set of items. The goal is to deliver as many items as possible at the lowest cost while obeying a set of constraints, such as time windows and capacities. The PDP is a well-studied, NP-hard problem, so approximation algorithms and heuristics have been developed to address variants of the PDP.\n",
    "There are many techniques we can use to solve the PDP problem, we can find genetic algorithms, various metaheuristics, taboo search heuristics and a branch and cut algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this logistic problem bigger we can make the vehicle that is delivering the product transfer it to another vehicle before the delivery its done. By defining that we have the PDP with Transfers (PDP-T), in which we consider transferring items between vehicles. We can convert the PDP problem into a PDP-T problem by adding some variables and constraints. "

    "## Literature Review\n",
    "As we saw before, there are different methods to solve the PDP-T problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a branch and cut method using Benders Decomposition. In this method, the set of constraints is decomposed into pure integer and mixed constraints, and then a branch-and-cut procedure is applied to the resulting pure integer problem, by using real variables and constraints related as cut generators. The key on the success of this method is that those constraints defined by a logical sentence are not modeled using the big-M technique, as usual in a branch-and-bound methodology behind the original PDP formulation. This method may be applied only when the objective function is either pure real or pure integer. \\citep{Cortes2010}\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method to solve it is Very Large Neighborhood Search with Transfers (VLNS-T) is based on the Adaptive Very Large Neighborhood Search (VLNS). The VLNS algorithm  uses  simulated  annealing  to  randomly  choose neighboring schedules and iteratively improve the schedule. Neighboring schedules are formed by removing random items and reinserting them with heuristics. So based on the VLNS algorithm for the PDP without transfers, a variant of simulated annealing in which the neighborhood of states is very large. In this case we remove random items from the schedule and then reinsert them with multiple heuristics to find neighbors. \\citep{Cata}\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also have some special cases of the PDP-T problem, as the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Shuttle Routes (PDP-S) which relies on a structured network with two categories of routes. Pickup routes visit a set of pickup points independently of their delivery points and end at one delivery point. Shuttle routes are direct trips between two delivery points. Requests can be transported in one leg (pickup route) or two legs (pickup route plus shuttle route) to their delivery point. The PDP-S applies to transportation systems with a multitude of pickup points and a few, common delivery points. \\citep{Masson2010}"

    "## Problem Description and Mathematic Formulation\n",
    "In the PDP, a heterogeneous vehicle fleet based at multiple terminals must satisfy a set of transportation requests. Each request is defined by a pickup point, a corresponding delivery point, and a demand to be transported between these locations\\citep{Parragh2008}, now, PDP-T allow the option for passengers to transfer between vehicles, provided that the locations of the transfer points are fixed and known.\n",
    "### Problem Formulation\n",
    "Let $N$ be the set of transportation requests. For each transportation request $i\\in N$ a load of size $\\bar{q_i}\\in \\mathbb{N}$ has to be transported from a set of origins $N^+_i$ to a set of destinations $N_i^+$. <br>\n",
    "Each load is subdivided as follows $\\displaystyle\\bar{q_i} = \\sum_{j\\in N_i^+}q_j = - \\sum_{j\\in N_i^-} q_j$, i.e., positive quantities for pickups and negative quantities for deliveries.<br>\n",
    "Define $\\displaystyle N^+ := \\cup_{i\\in N} N_i^+$ as the set of all origins and $\\displaystyle N^- := \\cup_{i\\in N} N_i^-$ as the set of all destinations. Let $V := N^+\\cup N^-$.<br>\n",
    "Furthermore, let $M$ be the set of vehicles. Each vehicle $k\\in M$ has a capacity $Q_k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ a start location $k^+$ and an end location $k^-$.\n",
    "<br>Define $M^+ := \\{k^+|k\\in M\\}$ as the set of start locations and $M^- := \\{k^-|k\\in M\\}$ as the set of end locations. Let $W := M^+ \\cup M^-$.<br>\n",
    "For all $i, j \\in V \\cup  W$ let $d_{ij}$ denote the travel distance, $t_{ij}$ the travel time and $c_{ij}$ the travel cost. Note that the dwell time at origins and destinations can be easily incorporated in the travel time and therefore will not be considered explicitly.<br>\n",
