# Pickup and Delivery with Transfer
In this repository we will be talking about Pickup and Delivery Problems with Transfers (PDP-T), the main idea is to show first the Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP), which is the problem from which the PDP-T derives from, later show a description of the problem and the mathematical formulation to get a clear view of what we are going to solve, which leads us to present different ways of solving this kind of problems.
